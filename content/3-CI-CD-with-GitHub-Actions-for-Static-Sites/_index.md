This section introduces how to set up a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** to automatically build and deploy static websites (e.g., Hugo) every time code is pushed to the repository. This ensures:

* Continuous integration (build on every commit)

* Continuous deployment (auto-publish changes)

* Consistency and reduced manual work
